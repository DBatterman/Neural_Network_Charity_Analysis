# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

For this project, we are helping the fictional company Alphabet Soup see whether or not a charity will be successful if they fund it. In order to accomplish this, we are going to use neural networking. By making a binary classifier, we can hopefully predict whether or not a charity will get funded before they even apply.
